        Hello, I’m Simon. Beyond my design work, I’m passionate about creativity, storytelling, 
        and using art as a way to connect with people. My journey started with pencil art and 
        grew into graphic design, branding, and digital experiences. This page is where you 
        get to know the person behind Simon Designs.
